# Picturebooks
Which objects are visible through the holes in a picture book? This visual task is easy for children, but perhaps hard for vision transformers.


### How to run this?
This is a visual eval implemented in the UK AI Safety Institute's [Inspect](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk) framework. After installing that, you can do a test run with `inspect eval picturebooks --model openai/gpt-4o-mini --limit 1` in the main directory and remove the `limit` parameter to go through all samples.
